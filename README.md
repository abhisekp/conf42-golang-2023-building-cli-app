Are you interested in building command-line interface (CLI) apps using Go, but not sure where to start? This engaging talk will provide you with all the information you need to build powerful, efficient, and user-friendly CLI apps using the native “flag” module in Go.

We’ll begin with an introduction to CLI development and explore the advantages of building CLI apps in Go. You’ll then learn about the “flag” module in Go, which is a powerful and flexible way to handle command-line arguments. We’ll cover best practices for building CLI apps using “flag”, including handling user input, parsing data, and generating multiple random data.

You don’t need to be an experienced developer to attend this talk - it’s perfect for both beginners and those with some experience in Go. You’ll come away with practical tips and techniques for building your own CLI apps in Go using the “flag” module, as well as a better understanding of the importance of CLI apps in your workflow.

**Don’t miss this opportunity to take your Go programming skills to the next level and discover the exciting world of CLI app development using the native “flag” module in Go!**
